# Deep Reinforcement Learning — Exercises

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the exercises of the module "Deep Reinforcement Learning" (Chemnitz University of Technology). Please enjoy this AI-generated ridiculously thorough README.

## TL;DR

- Only edit notebooks in `solutions/`. Mark solution cells with `A:` (markdown) or `# Solution:` (code).
- Commit and push those solution notebooks without any executed output (clear outputs before committing).
- On push/PR, GitHub Actions runs `scripts/process_notebooks.py` automatically to:
  - Create filtered student versions (without solutions) in `notebooks/`.
  - Execute solution notebooks and save the rendered versions (with outputs) in `solutions-output/`.
  - Add an "Open in Colab" button to the notebooks.

## How the workflow works

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow (see `.github/workflows/process-notebooks.yml`). When you push changes or open a pull request:

1. The workflow checks out the repo and installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. It runs the processing script `scripts/process_notebooks.py`.
3. The script automatically:
	- Produces filtered notebooks (without solution content) into `notebooks/`.
	- Executes the notebooks in `solutions/` and writes the executed notebooks (with outputs) to `solutions-output/`.
	- Injects an "Open in Colab" badge into the notebooks so students can launch them in Google Colab easily.

No manual steps are required beyond pushing your edits to `solutions/`.

### What “filtered” student versions include

The student-facing notebooks generated into `notebooks/` are filtered from the corresponding `solutions/` notebooks using simple, explicit markers:

- Markdown answer cells: any markdown cell whose first non-empty line begins with `A:` is omitted entirely from the filtered version.
- Solution code cells: any Python code cell whose first non-empty line begins with `# Solution:` is replaced by an empty code cell in the filtered version (a placeholder for students to fill in).
- Everything else (instructions, non-solution text, non-solution code like imports/utility functions) is kept as-is.

Tips for authoring solution cells:
- Prefix answer-only markdown with `A:` on the first line.
- Start solution code cells with `# Solution:` on the first line.
- Keep all other content free of those prefixes to ensure it remains visible to students.

## What to edit (and what not to)

- Do edit: files in `solutions/` (e.g., `solutions/04-Bandits.ipynb`).
- Do not edit: files in `notebooks/` and `solutions-output/`. These are generated by the automation and will be overwritten.

## Keep solution notebooks clean (no outputs)

Please ensure the notebooks you commit in `solutions/` have their outputs cleared:

- In JupyterLab/Notebook: Kernel → Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs (or Edit → Clear All Outputs), then save.
- With nbconvert (optional):
  ```bash
  jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace solutions/<Notebook>.ipynb
  ```

Committing clean notebooks keeps diffs small and avoids merge noise. The CI will execute solutions for you and publish the outputs to `solutions-output/`.

## Repository layout

- `solutions/` — Source of truth. Edit these notebooks; keep outputs cleared.
- `notebooks/` — Auto-generated student versions (filtered, without solutions). Do not edit.
- `solutions-output/` — Auto-generated executed solutions (with outputs). Do not edit.
- `scripts/process_notebooks.py` — The script that performs filtering, execution, and adds the Colab badge.
- `.github/workflows/process-notebooks.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow that runs the script on push/PR.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies used by the processing workflow.

## Running the processing script locally (optional)

If you want to preview the generated outputs locally:

1. Create/activate a Python environment and install dependencies:
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
2. Run the processor:
	```bash
	python scripts/process_notebooks.py
	```
3. Inspect results under `notebooks/` and `solutions-output/`.

Note: The CI will run exactly this script on the server when you push.

## Colab badge

The processing script automatically adds an "Open in Colab" button to notebooks so they can be launched in Google Colab. If the badge doesn't appear as expected, make sure the repo (or the target branch) is accessible and that the workflow has finished successfully.

## Common issues

- "I see outputs in a diff for a `solutions/` notebook": Clear outputs and push again. CI will regenerate executed notebooks in `solutions-output/`.
- "Changes to `notebooks/` got reverted": Those files are generated; make your edits in `solutions/` and let CI re-generate.
- "Workflow did not run": Check the Actions tab on GitHub, ensure your branch meets the workflow triggers, and that the run completed successfully.
